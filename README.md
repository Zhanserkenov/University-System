The Java project developed in Eclipse IDE encompasses a modular structure with packages, exceptions, and various classes. Notable components include:

Packages: Organized code into packages for better structure and management.

Exceptions: Implemented exception handling with specific exception classes such as CourseNotFoundException, InvalidSupervisorException, StudentNotFoundException, and TeacherNotFoundException.

Main and Menu Classes: The project includes main classes for execution, and menu-related classes like AdminMenu, EnterMenu, ManagerMenu, StudentMenu, TeacherMenu, TechSupportSpecialistMenu, and UserMenu for user interactions.

Data Classes: Numerous classes represent data entities such as Course, CourseName, Data, Degree, Employee, ExamType, Faculty, Format, Language, Lesson, ManageNews, Manager, ManagerType, Mark, Message, News, Organization, OrganizationName, ResearchPaper, ResearchProject, Researcher, Student, SupportRequest, Teacher, TeacherType, TechSupportSpecialist, TitleFaculty, Transcript, TypeLesson, User, UserPersonalInfo, and ViewInfo.

The project reflects a comprehensive approach to managing various aspects, ranging from educational entities (courses, degrees, lessons) to organizational elements (managers, news) and user roles (students, teachers, tech support specialists). The modular design allows for scalability and maintainability, while the exception handling ensures robust error management. The inclusion of menu classes suggests a user-friendly interface for interaction. Overall, the project appears to be a comprehensive information management system with diverse functionalities and a clear organization.
